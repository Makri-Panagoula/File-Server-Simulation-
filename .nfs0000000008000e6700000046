Thomas Gagne prepared new artwork for this edition. Owen Galvin helped
copy-edit Chapter 16. Mark Wogahn has made sure that the software to produce
this book (LATEX and fonts) works properly. Ranjan Kumar Meher rewrote some
of the LATEX software used in the production of this new text.
1.1.2 System View
From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program
most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view
an operating system as a resource allocator. A computer system has many
resources that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space,
file-storage space, I/O devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the
manager of these resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests
for resources, the operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific
programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and
fairly. As we have seen, resource allocation is especially important where many
users access the same mainframe or minicomputer.
A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to
control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a
control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs
to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned
with the operation and control of I/O devices.

1.1.3 Defining Operating Systems
By now, you can probably see that the term operating system covers many roles
and functions. That is the case, at least in part, because of the myriad designs
and uses of computers. Computers are present within toasters, cars, ships,
spacecraft, homes, and businesses. They are the basis for game machines, music
players, cable TV tuners, and industrial control systems. Although computers
have a relatively short history, they have evolved rapidly. Computing started
as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly moved to
fixed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and trajectory
plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation. Those early
computers evolved into general-purpose, multifunction mainframes, and
that’s when operating systems were born. In the 1960s, Moore’s Law predicted
that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every
eighteen months, and that prediction has held true. Computers gained in
no completely adequate definition of an operating system. Operating systems
