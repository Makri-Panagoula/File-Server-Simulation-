Tertiary storage is not crucial to system performance, but it still must
be managed. Some operating systems take on this task, while others leave
tertiary-storage management to application programs. Some of the functions
that operating systems can provide include mounting and unmounting media
in devices, allocating and freeing the devices for exclusive use by processes,
and migrating data from secondary to tertiary storage.
Techniques for secondary and tertiary storage management are discussed

secondary storage to tertiary storage, such as tape jukeboxes, to lower the
secondary storage to tertiary storage, such as tape jukeboxes, to lower the
storage cost (see Chapter 10).
The movement of information between levels of a storage hierarchy may
be either explicit or implicit, depending on the hardware design and the
controlling operating-system software. For instance, data transfer from cache
to CPU and registers is usually a hardware function, with no operating-system
intervention. In contrast, transfer of data from disk to memory is usually
controlled by the operating system.
In a hierarchical storage structure, the same data may appear in different
levels of the storage system. For example, suppose that an integer A that is to
be incremented by 1 is located in file B, and file B resides on magnetic disk.
The increment operation proceeds by first issuing an I/O operation to copy the
disk block on which A resides to main memory. This operation is followed by
copying A to the cache and to an internal register. Thus, the copy of A appears
in several places: on the magnetic disk, in main memory, in the cache, and in an
internal register (see Figure 1.12). Once the increment takes place in the internal
register, the value of A differs in the various storage systems. The value of A
becomes the same only after the new value of A is written from the internal
register back to the magnetic disk.
In a computing environment where only one process executes at a time,
this arrangement poses no difficulties, since an access to integer A will always
be to the copy at the highest level of the hierarchy. However, in a multitasking
environment, where the CPU is switched back and forth among various
processes, extreme care must be taken to ensure that, if several processes wish
to access A, then each of these processes will obtain the most recently updated
value of A.
The situation becomes more complicated in a multiprocessor environment
where, in addition to maintaining internal registers, each of the CPUs also
contains a local cache (Figure 1.6). In such an environment, a copy of A may
exist simultaneously in several caches. Since the various CPUs can all execute
in parallel, we must make sure that an update to the value of A in one cache
is immediately reflected in all other caches where A resides. This situation is
called cache coherency, and it is usually a hardware issue (handled below the
operating-system level).
In a distributed environment, the situation becomes even more complex.
In this environment, several copies (or replicas) of the same file can be kept on
different computers. Since the various replicas may be accessed and updated
concurrently, some distributed systems ensure that, when a replica is updated
in one place, all other replicas are brought up to date as soon as possible. There
